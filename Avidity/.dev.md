# Developer Notes


## Principles

- Never commit a broken build.
  - This makes rollbacks 20x harder.


<br>


## Notes

### Todo
- Make `Bases.Clicky` generic wrt its inherited class

### Plans
- For shuffle play, increment track weight with time, reset to 0 on play, so tracks that haven't been played recently are more likely!

### Thoughts
- Artists need albums, maybe tracks should auto-add on instantiation?
- Do playlists need to have an order? Could we use a Set instead?
- Collapse queued playlists?

### Maybe
- Sorting JSON exports alphabetically would be really helpful

## Weird Quirks

- Styling a custom component like `TrackRow` which is used in a `ListView` seems to produce duplicate stylings. Wonder if `ListView` is creating wrapper components or something. So weird.
