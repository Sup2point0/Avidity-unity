# Developer Notes


## Principles

- Never commit a broken build.
  - This makes rollbacks 20x harder.

## Notes

### Todo

### Plans
- For shuffle play, increment track weight with time, reset to 0 on play, so tracks that haven't been played recently are more likely!

### Thoughts
- Artists need albums, maybe tracks should auto-add on instantiation?
- Do playlists need to have an order? Could we use a Set instead?

### Maybe
- Sorting JSON exports alphabetically would be really helpful
